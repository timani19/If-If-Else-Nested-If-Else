
Switch Statement:

> When a variable has a list of same types of values- we can use Switch statement.

Like, Days, Month, Colors, 


> A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. 
Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each case.

> The body of a switch statement is known as a switch block. A statement in the switch block can be labeled with one or more case or 

default labels. The switch statement evaluates its expression, then executes all statements that follow the matching case label.


Rules:

* The variable used in a switch statement can only be integers, convertable integers (byte, short, char), strings and enums.

* When the variable being switched on is equal to a case, the statements following that case will execute until a break statement is reached.
