Control Flow:


IF - then Statement:

> In if statement, one condition will be given and it has to be true.

> It tells your program to execute a certain section of code only if a particular test evaluates to true.

> Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true


Example:

int x=10;
int y=5;

if (x>y) {  // so here this condition HAS to be TRUE to execute the below code

sout("x is greater than y);



If this condition evaluates to false (x is not greater than y), control jumps to the end of the if-then statement.



If-Then-Else Statment:

> this block of condition will execute when if condition is False. 


Rules:

If: will execute when the condition is true

else if: If the first if condition is false, then it will come to this condition

and check if it is true. If this is true will execute this section of code


else: If first two conditions are false, then it will execute the Else condition


SYNTAX:


if (condition)
statement-1;

else if (condition)
statement-2;

else if (condition)
statement-n;

else
statement-default;
